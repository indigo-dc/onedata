### 21.02.0-alpha11

-   **VFS-7663** Changed background image of sign-in page in Onezone and
    Onepanel.
-   **VFS-7648** Added Web GUI views for browsing and creating datasets
    and archives.
-   **VFS-7589** Added StorageRouter and BufferedStorage helpers to
    handling of aggregate storages such as archive storage.
-   **VFS-7304** Add preliminary REST API for dataset archivization - to
    be extended in near future.

### 21.02.0-alpha10

### 21.02.0-alpha9

-   **VFS-7592** Added support for the Range header during directory or
    multi file (bulk) downloads, making it possible to resume them in
    case of interruption or network failure.


### 21.02.0-alpha8

-   **VFS-7575** Add the possibility to incorporate an XRootD server
    within the Onedata environment for exposing Open Data collections
    for public access using the XRootD protocol.
-   **VFS-7510** Add API for browsing dataset structures, separately for
    datasets in attached and detached state. The datasets can be listed
    using batches of requested size, with desired starting point and
    offset.

### 21.02.0-alpha7

-   **VFS-7517** Several bug fixes related to edge-cases when moving or
    deleting files.
-   **VFS-7509** Added support for absolute symlinks relative to
    Oneclient mountpoint, i.e. always pointing to the same file in a
    space, regardless of actual Oneclient mountpoint path.
-   **VFS-7429** Implemented the concept of datasets. Datasets allow the
    space users to organize their data into collections with desired
    granularity. A file or directory marked as a dataset offers
    additional features, such as optional data and metadata protection
    or the ability to create persistent snapshots of the physical
    dataset contents. In case of a directory, a dataset covers all its
    subdirectories and files. Datasets can be nested, allowing users to
    compose arbitrary hierarchical structures. Added corresponding views
    for managing datasets and write protection flags in file browser Web
    GUI and a REST API, accessible under \`/datasets\`,
    \`/datasets/{DatasetId}\` and \`/data/{FileId}/dataset/summary\`
    paths.
-   **VFS-7428** Added support for hard links and symlinks. Added
    corresponding REST api specific for hard and symbolic links,
    accessible under /data/{FileId}/hardlinks and
    /data/{FileId}/symlink\_value paths.
-   **VFS-7360** Added support for hardlinks and symlinks through
    Oneclient POSIX interface.
-   **VFS-7305** Basic support for hard links and symbolic links on the
    filesystem level, interaction with high-level mechanisms such as
    data transfers, storage import or QoS is still to be refined.

### 21.02.0-alpha6

-   **VFS-7486** Added option to nulldevice helper allowing control of
    file size returned by getattr in simulated file systems.

### 21.02.0-alpha5

-   **VFS-7358** Added support for accessing open data shares in
    oneclient with \--open-shares-mode option.
-   **VFS-7351** It is now possible to download directories and multiple
    files via gui as a compressed TAR archive.
-   **VFS-7294** Added publicly available REST endpoints for fetching
    information and data of shared files/directories. The data-related
    endpoints are offered by Onezone, which redirects to a suitable
    Oneprovider so that a guest user does not need any knowledge of the
    environment to access the data. Improved the Web GUI\'s shares view
    to present the public endpoints in an easy-to-use manner.

### 21.02.0-alpha4

-   **VFS-7397** Added new option to oneclient \`\--show-space-ids\`
    which allows to list spaces using their space Id\'s instead of names
    in the top level oneclient mount directory.
-   **VFS-7378** Removed deprecated Oneprovider REST API. The modern
    API, available since versions 20.02.\*, operates on file IDs rather
    than paths. A special endpoint for resolving file IDs based on paths
    is available.

### 21.02.0-alpha3

-   **VFS-7275** Improved Oneclient exception handling, including
    connection errors and invalid tokens.
-   **VFS-6638** Fixed handling duplicate clusters states on clusters
    list in GUI.

### 21.02.0-alpha2

-   **VFS-7280** Fixed page reload after Let\'s Encrypt certificate
    generation via Onepanel GUI.
-   **VFS-7276** Improved handling of startup errors in Oneclient,
    including more graceful handling of various exceptions and more
    informative error messages including Oneclient and Oneprovider
    compatibility and invalid token issues.
-   **VFS-7274** Added SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers to Oneclient,
    ensuring that after the oneclient process is stopped by some other
    process, the mountpoint is properly released.
-   **VFS-7256** Fixed OnedataFS token refresh, which caused
    disconnection from Oneprovider after the token expired.
-   **VFS-7165** Add a workaround for Erlang\'s SSL implementation that
    would not reload server certificate chain when it is changed (e.g.
    after Let\'s Encrypt certificate regeneration).
-   **VFS-6566** Improved UX and fixed minor issues in share views.
    Fixed inability to open share hosted by Oneprovider 19.02.x using
    Onezone 20.02.x.

    Conda packages.
-   **VFS-9415** *(Oneprovider)* Improved display of sensitive storage
    config details in Onepanel GUI to show censored values instead of
    hiding them completely.

### 20.02.16

-   **VFS-9182** *(Onezone)* Improved EGI group mapping for special COU
    groups \"admins\" and \"members\"; their names are now concatenated
    with parent group names for better presentation. Additionally,
    \"admins\" groups now get admin privileges in their parent groups
    instead of default member privileges.
-   **VFS-9119** *(Oneprovider)* Introduced a temporary fix for uid/gid
    encoding of values outside of signed int32 range - the values are
    trimmed to the value of 2,147,483,646 for displaying in Oneclient.
    Full support for unsigned int32 range (in alignment with POSIX
    uid\_t and gid\_t types) will be introduced in the next major
    release.
-   **VFS-9118** *(Oneprovider)* Import ignores other file types than
    regular and directories (i.e., fifo, symlink).
-   **VFS-8939** *(Oneprovider)* Fixed a bug related to path caveats in
    access tokens, where a Oneclient user would see the names of newly
    created files/directories outside of the allowed paths (but was not
    able to access them).
-   **VFS-8828** *(Oneclient, Oneprovider, S3Adapter)* Fixed conda
    packages for the stable branch 20.02.\*, starting with version
    20.02.15 and Python 3.9.

    information and data of shared files/directories. The data-related
    endpoints are offered by Onezone, which redirects to a suitable
    Oneprovider so that a guest user does not need any knowledge of the
    environment to access the data. Improved the Web GUI's shares view
    to present the public endpoints in an easy-to-use manner.

    using GUI.
-   **VFS-6745** Added new view with token templates in tokens creator
    GUI.

### 20.02.4

-   **VFS-7015** Added I/O proxy fallback in direct access mode in
    Oneclient, allowing to access files for which permissions on a
    specific storage are not properly configured, even when global
    permissions allow access.
-   **VFS-7003** Added new counters presenting progress of current/last
    finished scan of the storage import mechanism - number of all
    processed files (\`Processed files\`) and the total number of files
    residing on the storage during the scan (\`Total storage files\`).
-   **VFS-6958** Added new endpoint that checks correctness of a QoS
    expression and returns the list of storages that match the
    expression.
-   **VFS-6940** Fix truncating of sparse files.

    macOS using HiDPI display.
-   **VFS-6853** Matching session cookie is now required to verify a GUI
    access tokens (they are used behind the scenes by the Onedata web
    applications), which increases security.
-   **VFS-6851** Fixed a security issue in Oneprovider share GUI.
-   **VFS-6845** Prevent application from stopping until all documents
    are correctly persisted in order to improve resistance to temporary
    database errors.

    a special command line flag --enable-archivematica, which toggles
    automatic generation of Archivematica configuration and metadata
    virtual files in the Fuse file system.
-   **VFS-6623** S3 storage helper now supports public buckets, which do
    not require any credentials. The access and secret keys can be left
    empty when adding storage.
-   **VFS-6577** Improve data transfer performance to object storages
    (e.g. S3) by aligning transferred block size to the object size on

    data into Onedata spaces without need for copying the data. The
    mechanism is now called "storage import". Introduced modes of
    storage import: "manual" which allows for manual registration of
    files and "auto" which enables automatic detection and import of
    files from the storage. Introduced possibility to forcefully
    start/stop scans of auto storage import. Redesigned GUI related to
    storage import, adjusted to the new features.


### 20.02.1

-   **VFS-6668** Fix bug resulting in timeouts of workers after 30s.
-   **VFS-6645** Optimize changes querrying.
-   **VFS-6628** Extended harvesting configuration - it is now possible
    to select harvesting options, like metadata types to harvest or
    additional file details (fileName, spaceId), upon index creation.
    New metadata types are now harvestable - xattrs and rdf. Default
    values of HarvestingBackendType and HarvestingBackendEndpoint can
    now be set by Onezone admin - if set, these values can be omitted
    when creating a new harvester. New option (retry\_on\_rejection)
    allowing for all payloads rejected by the harvesting backend to be
    automatically analysed for offending data (e.g. fields that do not
    match the schema), pruned and submitted again.
-   **VFS-6580** Fixed bug that could block dbsync on-demand streams on
    multi-node deployments.
-   **VFS-6577** Improve data transfer performance to object storages
    (e.g. S3) by aligning transferred block size to the object size on
    target storage, thus minimizing the overhead necessary when updating
    a file object with partial content.
-   **VFS-6568** Introduced concept of readonly storage. If enabled,
    Oneprovider will block any operation that writes, modifies or
    deletes data on the storage. Such storage can only be used to import
    data into the space. Mandatory to ensure proper behaviour if the
    backend storage is actually configured as readonly.
-   **VFS-6547** Fixed switching between spaces in file browser GUI
    during upload.
-   **VFS-6535** Updated S3 SDK library to 1.8.7.
-   **VFS-6504** Added HTTP storage helper allowing registration of HTTP
    and HTTPS servers as storage sources for Onedata Spaces.
-   **VFS-6494** Introduced REST API for registering files.
-   **VFS-6474** Added initial support for XRootD storage, including
    direct access to XRootD storages and importing of legacy data sets
    stored on XRootD or EOS servers.

    description (supports the markdown format).
-   **VFS-6456** Do not allow the user to perform actions in the GUI
    related to transfers without the appropriate permissions.
-   **VFS-6455** Support for jumping to selected files in GUI, even if
    they are not visible on infinite-scroll list.
-   **VFS-6453** New Open Data and share description views with visual
    Dublin Core editor and Markdown editor.
-   **VFS-6450** Added file name and space id to harvested file
    metadata.
-   **VFS-6431** Added performance logs for object storages, which can
    generate CSV file containing all storage requests including their
    duration.
-   **VFS-6421** New generic GUI plugin for harvesters.
-   **VFS-6378** Onepanel GUI and REST API now explicitly block
    supporting a space with more than one imported storage (globally) -
    such operation was possible in the past but was never supported by
    the internal storage import logic and led to incoherent view on
    space data.
-   **VFS-6370** Create secure fold mechanism on model documents.
-   **VFS-6361** Added new REST api for creating transfers and viewing
    file distribution, accessible respectively under \`/transfers\` and
    \`/data/{fileId}/distribution\` paths. Old \`/replicas\`,
    \`/replicas-id\` and \`/replicas-view\` endpoints were deprecated
    and will be removed in next major release.
-   **VFS-6358** Optimization of files upload through GUI.
-   **VFS-6346** GUI improvements: added Oneprovider GUI notifications,
    better file selection, additional error handling, better file
    manager refresh UX, fixed overflow of context menu in file browser,
    fixes in responsive layout.
-   **VFS-6344** GUI: showing information if QoS requirement is
    impossible to be fulfilled.
-   **VFS-6343** Added delete account feature in GUI.
-   **VFS-6320** Old \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes\`,
    \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes/{index\_name}\`,
    \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes/{index\_name}/reduce\` and
    \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes/{index\_name}/query\` endpoints were
    deprecated and will be removed in next major release.
-   **VFS-6316** Added \`statfs\` support enabling preview of available
    storage in each space through oneclient, for instance using \`df\`
    or \`stat\` utilities.
-   **VFS-6288** Basic HA functionality (experimental) - protect
    Oneprovider from single node failure.
-   **VFS-6287** Integrate traverse pools with HA sub-system.
-   **VFS-6263** New experimental Quality of Service functionality. It
    is used to manage file replica distribution and redundancy between
    supporting Oneproviders. Users can define any number of QoS
    requirements for a file or directory. Each requirement consists of
    target replicas number and an expression that is used to select
    storages where the replicas should be placed ‐ it is matched against
    parameters that were assigned to storages by Oneprovider admins.
-   **VFS-6261** Integrate high-level services with HA sub-system.
-   **VFS-6225** Added new \`triggers\` field to changes stream
    specification allowing to send events only on specified docs types
    changes.
-   **VFS-6184** Added the space owner concept. Space owner works like
    \"root\" within the space - such user is allowed to perform all
    file/API operations, regardless of the assigned privileges and file
    permissions / ACLs. Ownership can be assigned to any number of
    users, and it is forbidden to leave a space without an owner -
    ownership must be transferred first.
-   **VFS-6167** Allow nodes adding and deleting in-fly basing on HA
    sub-system.
-   **VFS-6160** Reorganized Local User Mapping (LUMA) management.
    Introduced feeds for populating LUMA DB.
-   **VFS-6095** Mask private file attributes, such as uid or gid, when
    showing file attrs in share mode.
-   **VFS-5648** Extended QoS expression to allow comparators (\<, \>,
    \<=, \>=) and numeric values. Changed \"-\" operator to \"\\\".
    Space characters (\" \"), dashes (\"-\") and underscores (\"\_\")
    are now allowed in QoS parameters. Added more details to invalid QoS
    expression errors.
-   **VFS-4760** Added implicit API caveats that limit access tokens
    used by Onedata GUIs behind the scenes for authentication and
    authorization. Different services in the system are presented with
    user\'s access token with power limited to bare minimum required for
    the service to handle user requests. For example, Oneproviders do
    not have access to APIs that could alter or delete user data and
    memberships.

### 20.02.0-beta4

-   **VFS-6359** Fixed an issue with accessing files in spaces which are
    not supported by the Oneprovider instance to which Oneclient is
    currently connected.
-   **VFS-6356** Fixed an error with caching of file location map in

    size during choice of blocks to be replicated.
-   **VFS-6578** Fix events manager initialization to prevent races
    between events.
-   **VFS-6540** Files upload GUI optimization using optimal (per space)
    upload file chunk size.
-   **VFS-6438** Decrease overhead of transfers of already replicated
    files. Optimization of on demand synchronization streams usage.
-   **VFS-6401** All authentication errors are now wrapped in
    UNAUTHORIZED error and map to 401 HTTP code to avoid ambiguity when
    reporting token related errors - tokens can be used for
    authentication as well as input data for some operations (e.g.
    invite tokens).
-   **VFS-6390** Because of asynchronous processing, it was possible
    that GraphSync session cleanup intertwined with deleted record
    cleanup (that removes corresponding subscriptions from sessions,
    possibly including the session being cleaned up) and caused an error
    that interrupted change propagation. Now, if the session is no
    longer existent, subscription removal errors are ignored and the
    propagation completes.
-   **VFS-6369** Fix datastore internal call, batch management during
    links listing and infinite loop during storage directories creation.
